	<h3>ExtraHop Installation</h3>
	<p>For ExtraHop installation and configuration instructions visit <a href="https://www.extrahop.com/customers/community/bundles/extrahop-created/">bundles.extrahop.com</a>.</p>
	<p>The Splunk SOAR integration for ExtraHop enables you to automate and orchestrate rapid security investigation, response, and remediation workflows. ExtraHop Reveal(x) provides a uniquely rich, real-time data source by turning unstructured packets into structured wire data and analyzing it in real-time. Based on this data, you can confidently configure Splunk SOAR to automate security workflows and investigations and orchestrate precise, rapid responses to security threats more effectively than ever before.</p>
	<p>The Extrahop and Splunk SOAR connect through simple, powerful REST APIs, making it easy to build and iterate new use cases to get the most value for the least effort, a vital capability for thinly stretched enterprise security teams.</p>
